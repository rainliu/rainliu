Rain Liu is a Rustacean with expertise in V²oIP/RTC.

"We choose to use Rust, not because it is easy, but because it is hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too."

"Any application that can be written in Rust, will eventually be written in Rust."
